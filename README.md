# ðŸ“Š Sales Analytics Dashboard (SQL Project)

This project demonstrates how I used **MySQL Workbench** to build a real-world **Sales Analytics backend** using pure **SQL**. It covers schema design, data modeling, business-focused queries, and reusable views â€” everything needed to support a sales reporting system or power a future dashboard. 
The goal was to extract actionable insights from sales data using SQL alone, without relying on visualization tools.
